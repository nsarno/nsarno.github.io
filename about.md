## About Code & Stuff

I research new stuff about programming everyday, which is actually why I love Computer Science in the first place. But it's getting hard to organize all that knowledge and keep track of things I learned. That's why I decided to start documenting some of my research here. I will be easier for me to refer to it later and hopefully some people might find it useful.

I've also been teaching C for a few years and I found out that having to put my own knowledge into words for others to understand helped me a lot raising my own level.
